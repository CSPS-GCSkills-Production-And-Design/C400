	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>One thousand homeowners in Wingham received a rain barrel with a capacity to hold 203 litres (45 gallons) of water. A public education campaign and information sessions generated support for the program.</p>

<p>Wingham residents were reminded that this simple preventive measure would help them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reduce/eliminate the risk of their house or property being flooded</li>
	<li>save money on their water bill</li>
	<li>reduce demand for township-treated water</li>
	<li>do their part to help reduce the number of sewer overload incidences in the Wingham community</li>
	<li>help the environment and set an example for other communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to a simple preventive measure involving 1000 people using a water barrel, 4.5 million litres of rainwater could be diverted from a municipalityâ€™s sewer system.</p>

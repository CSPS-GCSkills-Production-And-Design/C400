<p>As our risk environment continues to evolve with increasing frequency and severity of hazards and threats to Canadians, this component of the emergency management process is becoming ever more important.</p>

<p>In this module, we have seen various examples of prevention/mitigation efforts from all levels of government. The Red River Floodway and the use of rain barrels are two examples of how serious flooding can be avoided.</p>

<p>Strategies should be collaborative and comprehensive. They should be based on all-hazards risk assessments and combined with targeted prevention/mitigation initiatives. When this occurs, the benefits can be counted in the saving of lives, property and livelihoods from the destructive impact of disasters.</p>

<p>As you leave this module, we encourage you to reflect not only on the Government of Canadaâ€™s efforts in emergency prevention and mitigation, but also your own; now is as good a time as any to conduct a risk analysis in your home and personal surroundings and to put measures in place to protect them.</p>

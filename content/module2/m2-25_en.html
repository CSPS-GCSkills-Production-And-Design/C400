	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Here is a final example of emergency management in action at the local level. Itâ€™s a reminder of how prevention/mitigation measures are not always complex or expensive and can begin with the individual.</p>

<p>In 2009, Wingham, a residential town 250 km from Toronto, participated in a pilot program sponsored by the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) to mitigate a perennial hazard facing homeowners: sewer back-up overflows during intense rain storms.</p>

<p>Sewer back-ups resulting from increased rainfall are a growing problem for many communities across Canada. Water run-off from roofs and driveways during intense rainfall results in overloaded sewer systems. This leads to sewer back-ups and the discharge of untreated and contaminated water.</p>

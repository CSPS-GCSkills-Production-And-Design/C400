<p>The GOC is the hub of a network of federal operations centres and provides stable, round-the-clock coordination and support to key national players in the event of national emergencies.</p>

<p>It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, compiling information from other operations centres and a wide variety of sources, both open and classified, from around the world.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of its <strong>day-to-day</strong> operational responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>provide stable, round-the-clock monitoring, validation, reporting and response functions in relation to events of national interest</li>
	<li>develop situational awareness and risk assessment products</li>
	<li>coordinate the development of event-specific contingency planning</li>
